# D&D Backend System Fixes Report

## Overview
This report documents the issues found and fixes applied to resolve failures in the user profile system, messaging system, and game system.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Mismatches

The main root cause was database schema mismatches between the controllers and the actual database migrations. The compiled JavaScript was using incorrect column names that didn't match the database schema.

#### Issue 1.1: Chat Messages System
**Problem**: The `getChatMessages` and `sendChatMessage` functions were trying to use a `character_id` column that doesn't exist in the `chat_messages` table.

**Error Log**:
```
SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: chat_messages.character_id
```

**Root Cause**: The migration `009_create_chat_messages.ts` only creates columns for `user_id` but not `character_id`. The controller was incorrectly assuming this column existed.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `character_id` references from `getChatMessages` function
- Removed `character_id` references from `sendChatMessage` function  
- Fixed column name from `created_at` to `timestamp` (correct column name from migration)
- Fixed column name from `message_type` to `type` (correct column name from migration)

#### Issue 1.2: Game Players System
**Problem**: The game system was failing to join games due to NULL character_id constraint failures.

**Error Log**:
```
SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: NOT NULL constraint failed: game_players.character_id
```

**Root Cause**: Migration `013_make_character_id_nullable.ts` was supposed to make character_id nullable to allow DMs to join without characters, but the controller was still treating it as required.

**Status**: This was already handled correctly in the source code after the migration was applied.

### 2. Authentication System Issues

#### Issue 2.1: Token Column Names
**Problem**: Authentication middleware was looking for incorrect column names in auth_tokens table.

**Error Log**: 
```
SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: is_active
```

**Root Cause**: The compiled JavaScript was using `is_active` instead of `is_revoked` from the migration.

**Fix Applied**: Rebuild resolved this issue as the source code was already correct.

### 3. Game System Issues

#### Issue 3.1: Game Session Creation
**Problem**: Game creation was failing due to incorrect column name usage.

**Error Log**:
```
SQLITE_ERROR: table game_sessions has no column named settings
```

**Root Cause**: The compiled JavaScript was using `settings` instead of `game_state` and `ai_settings`.

**Fix Applied**: Rebuild resolved this issue as the source code was already correct.

## Systems Status After Fixes

### ✅ User Profile System
- **Status**: **WORKING**
- User registration and login functioning properly
- Profile retrieval and updates working
- Friend system operational (friend requests, accept/decline)

### ✅ Messaging System  
- **Status**: **WORKING**
- Direct messaging between friends operational
- Conversation retrieval working
- Message sending and receiving functional

### ✅ Game System
- **Status**: **WORKING**
- Game creation and joining functional
- Game state management operational
- Chat system within games working (after schema fixes)
- Dice rolling system functional

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Corrections Made

1. **Chat Messages Schema**:
   - Removed non-existent `character_id` column references
   - Fixed `created_at` → `timestamp` column name
   - Fixed `message_type` → `type` column name

2. **Authentication Tokens Schema**:
   - Confirmed correct usage of `is_revoked` instead of `is_active`

3. **Game Sessions Schema**:
   - Confirmed correct usage of `game_state` and `ai_settings` columns

### Files Modified

1. `packages/backend/src/controllers/games.ts`
   - Fixed `getChatMessages` function schema issues
   - Fixed `sendChatMessage` function schema issues
   - Removed character_id references from chat system

## Testing Results

- **Server Health**: ✅ Healthy (http://localhost:3000/health responding)
- **Authentication**: ✅ Working (login/register functional)
- **Game Creation**: ✅ Working (can create and join games)
- **Chat System**: ✅ Working (game chat functional)
- **User Profiles**: ✅ Working (profile CRUD operations)
- **Messaging**: ✅ Working (direct messages between users)

## Recommendations

1. **Database Schema Validation**: Implement automated tests to validate controller queries against actual database schema
2. **Type Safety**: Consider using a typed ORM like Prisma to prevent schema mismatches
3. **Migration Testing**: Add tests that verify migrations work correctly with existing controllers
4. **CI/CD**: Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline to catch schema issues early

## Summary

All three systems (user profile, messaging, and game) are now **fully functional**. The main issues were database schema mismatches that occurred due to:
- Incorrect column name usage in compiled JavaScript
- Missing/incorrect column references in chat system
- Outdated compiled code that didn't match the TypeScript source

The fixes involved correcting the database queries to match the actual schema defined in the migrations, rebuilding the TypeScript code, and restarting the server. All systems are now operational and ready for use.
