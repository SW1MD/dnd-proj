### Priority Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1**: Basic game board and character positioning
2. **Phase 2**: Turn management and basic combat
3. **Phase 3**: DM interface and game controls
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and polish

## Conclusion

The application has a **solid foundation** with complete backend infrastructure and user management systems. The **critical missing piece** is the actual gameplay interface - the interactive game board, turn management, and real-time game state management that would make this a functional D&D gaming platform.

The backend is well-architected to support these features through existing WebSocket services, game state management, and action logging systems. The main work needed is frontend interface development for the actual gameplay experience.
